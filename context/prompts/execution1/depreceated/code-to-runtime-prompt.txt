You are given a single JSON object that is a data dump of a TypeScript/Node.js project’s file tree. It includes file paths, file contents (escaped strings), and types. Your job is to ANALYZE that dump and OUTPUT a single JSON object that linearizes runtime flows for ALL divergent HTTP endpoints and timer-driven paths, TRACKS step-level input state, and—when multiple flows converge into the same standardized logic—APPENDS a compact “common resolution” layer that captures that standardized tail behavior.

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS
- Do NOT invent endpoints, inputs, or code paths that are not present in the dump.
- Follow the extraction rules precisely.
- Output MUST be valid JSON matching the schema exactly.
- Use concise, human-readable text derived from actual code.
- Every endpoint/branch you include MUST be supported by code in the dump.
- When multiple flows converge on the same sequence of actions (standardized business logic), summarize that tail once in a dedicated "commonResolution" block (see schema). Do NOT omit branch-specific steps that lead up to it.

INPUT FORMAT (what you receive)
- A single JSON document with shape:
  {
    "name": "<root>",
    "type": "dir",
    "contents": [ FileNode | DirNode, ... ]
  }
- File node: { "name": "<filename>", "type": "<ext or 'file'>", "contents": "<escaped source code string>" }
- Directory node: { "name": "<dirname>", "type": "dir", "contents": [ ... ] }

OUTPUT FORMAT (what you must return)
Return exactly one JSON object with this top-level shape:

SCHEMA RULES & DEFAULTS
- executionFlows: array, length ≥ 1.
- endpoint: REQUIRED. For HTTP, use "METHOD /path". For timers/background jobs, use "timer:<name>".
- description: REQUIRED (one sentence).
- steps: REQUIRED, non-empty. Each step includes "state" with BOTH "inputs" and "changes" objects (use {} if none).
- branches: OPTIONAL. Only when code shows explicit conditional logic.
- commonResolution (per-flow): OPTIONAL. Include when THIS flow’s branches converge to the same standardized tail sequence.
- globalCommonResolution (cross-flow): OPTIONAL. Include when two or more DISTINCT endpoints share an identical tail. Prefer this instead of duplicating identical per-flow tails.
- Do NOT duplicate layers: if globalCommonResolution fully covers a flow’s tail, you may omit that flow’s commonResolution and rely on "appliesTo".
- Keep actions short and concrete; reflect actual code.

EXTRACTION RULES (derive flows + state + common resolution)
1) ROUTES → ENDPOINTS
   - Find Express routers and their mounts. Combine base mount paths with child routes to produce full endpoints.
   - Each endpoint = one executionFlow.

2) CONTROLLERS → INPUTS, BRANCHES, HANDOFF
   - For each route handler, add a Controller step capturing accessed request inputs in state.inputs (body/query/params/headers).
   - Capture env vars read at this step under state.inputs.env.
   - If there’s an if/else or switch, add branches with conditions matching code predicates; within each branch, continue steps linearly.

3) SERVICES → CORE ACTIONS + STATE
   - Summarize service actions (send/reset/status/etc.). Include parameters passed in under state.inputs.
   - Record state mutations (e.g., index++, timestamps) under state.changes.

4) TWILIO → SEND + STATE
   - For outbound sends, add a Twilio step with to/body/statusCallback in state.inputs.
   - If responses affect persisted state, reflect that in state.changes.

5) STATE MANAGEMENT → PERSISTENCE
   - When saving to on-disk JSON or equivalent, record new values (index, messageCount, lastMessageTime, isActive) in state.changes.

6) TIMERS/BACKGROUND → STATE
   - Timer start: record timer init in state.changes.
   - Timer tick: set state.inputs.timer.elapsedMinutes.
   - 25/30-minute triggers: include system message text under state.inputs.body and any index reset in state.changes.

7) COMMON RESOLUTION DETECTION (IMPORTANT)
   - After building steps for all branches within a flow, compare the final N steps across branches.
   - If ≥2 branches share an identical tail (same actor/action semantics and same kinds of state changes), extract that tail into "commonResolution" for that flow. Replace those duplicated tail steps in branches with a single "appliesWhen" reference.
   - After processing all flows, compare tails ACROSS different endpoints. If ≥2 endpoints share the same tail, extract it into "globalCommonResolution" with an explicit "signature" and "appliesTo".

QUALITY & CONSTRAINTS
- No commentary outside the JSON.
- Do NOT omit the divergent branch steps—common resolution is appended, not a substitute for branching detail.
- Only summarize as "common" when tails are truly identical in behavior; otherwise keep them per-branch.
- Preserve true step order before the common tail.
- Use empty {} for "inputs"/"changes" when not applicable; never omit the "state" object.

VALIDATION PASS (before you output)
- Every flow has endpoint, description, steps (with state), and valid (optional) commonResolution.
- If globalCommonResolution exists, "appliesTo" lists ≥2 endpoints and layers are generic enough to fit all listed flows.
- JSON is syntactically valid.
