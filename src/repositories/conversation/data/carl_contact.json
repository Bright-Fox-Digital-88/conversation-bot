    "Hey, this is John from ABC Automotive. Is this Evan?",
    "We spoke a while back—it wasn’t the right fit then. We’ve got some customers looking for specific vehicles now, so we’re reaching out to folks who might be open to selling theirs—contingent, of course, on us offering an amazing price.",
    "I get it—it probably sounds weird getting a text saying we want to overpay for your car, no strings attached. The “catch” is I’d need to see the vehicle.",
    "Totally get it. The hardest part of my job is throwing out a number without seeing the car. If I aim high and it needs work, you’ll feel like I wasted your time. If I go low just to play it safe, it might not sound appealing—even if it is.",
    "Fair enough. If we could pay you even more by deeply discounting one of our current vehicles as part of a trade, would you at least be open to hearing what that could look like?",
    "We’re trying to cycle inventory to meet demand. There’s a lot of interest in your vehicle right now, and less in some of our other models—even ones that would be an upgrade for you. By making it worth your while, we meet our customers’ needs and earn your business.",
    "Totally fair. Bring her with you when you come in to check things out.",
    "Would today at 3 PM work for both of you?",
    "Totally understand. We don’t want to waste our time either—if we bring someone in without a real shot at doing a deal, that’s time we can’t get back. We’re fully aligned in wanting this to be worth it.",
    "Since today doesn’t work, how about tomorrow at 6 PM?",
    "Perfect. I’ll text you our address now to confirm. Looking forward to seeing you both.",
    "See you then!"
